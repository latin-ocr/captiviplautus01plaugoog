PREFACE

μ

In preparing this edition of the Captivi, l have been guided

mainly by what my experience shows to be the 'requirements

of moderately advanced students. In the notes an attempt
¹ has been made to unite brevity of expression with sufficiency
in the explanation of necessary points. Few translations are
given-and those are, for the most part, as literal as possible-
as I find that if a boy is presented with an idiomatis translation,
he brings a parrot-like recollection of it into form or examina-
ti0n‚ without having troubled to enquire for himself how it
was obtained. In this way he misses a great part of the good
to be gained from studying the language; his memory may be
strengthened, but his power of observation is certainly blunted.
It is far preferable that a boy should hammer out the meaning
for himself, and then correct his style either with the assistance
of his tutor, or by means of the specimen translations which
are given at the end of the book.

For the text I have followed mainly the Teubner edition,
using, however, my own judgment in certain disputed passages,
and rejecting many of the expedients which Schoell and others
employ in order to avoid hiatus. That Plautus frequently made
η use of the hiatus, I cannot doubt ; and I have only adopted
the suggestions embodied in the Teubner text when homoeo
teleuton, or some other similarity in neighbouring words, might
have caused the omission of one of them.

In the account of the¹ Prosody no attempt has been made

at completeness. Such a taslr would be impossible in avolume
