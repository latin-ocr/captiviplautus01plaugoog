INTRODUCTION

1. Tun ern or Pnnunus

Titus Maccius Plautus was born about the year 255 ne. in the
little Umbrian town of Sassina. His origin was almost certainly
humble, and was possibly even servile. At some unknown date he
migrated to Rome, where asan actor he amassed a sum os money
which he soon lost in speculation. He then followed the example
ol many another actor, and turned playwright—at least, sofar as

, that name can be applied to one who merely translates and adapts

the works of a foreign dramatist. His literary activity, which began
in 2²4 nc, was only terminated by his death in 184 No less than .
r 30 plays were attributed to his pen in ancient times, but ol these
only 20 are extant. Though it is not easy to believe that the
survival ol these plays is due (in every case) to their superlative
merit,-f0r some of them are dull and stupid to a degree—we
know too little of the history of the Plautine writings to be able to ἢ
assign any reason lor the accidental survival of these plays and the
loss of the remainder. A possible explanation is that the 20 extant
plays are genuine, while the lost plays are only “Plautine''-that is,
they are the productions of a body of men who wrote under the
same circumstances and with the same aims as Plautus, though,
from the greater popularity and fame of the latter, they were all
attributed to him when their proper authors had been lorgotten.
The whole of the surviving plays, with one possible exception—
the Amphitryon-are adapted from the Greek New Comedy‚
especially from the words of Philemon, Diphilus, and Menander.
They are known as fabulae palliatae, because the male characters
appeared in the Greek palliam, and not in the Roman toga. Yet
in spite of Greek scenes, Greek costumes, and Greek names, we

probably have in Plautus a very accurate representation of the ¹

Roman manners of the period. Ιχ
