PLAUTl CAPTlVl

rr. Tun Ronnw Tuumne

Though the Romans borrowed from Greece all the other elements
ol their drama, they were long in imitating the magnificence os the
Greek theatres, and the stage on which the plays os Plautus·⁴vvere
exhibited was rude in the extreme. Until nearly a generation
after the death oi Plautus, the theatre was merely a temporary
construction; in 154 Scipio Nasica, on the ground os public
morals, successfully opposed the building os a permanent theatre,
though the contract for it had already been made. Until the
erection oi a‘ permanent theatre, temporary constructions were
employed, consisting ot a raised wooden stage (pulpitum) standing
in front os an omamented background (scaena). The auditorium
or cavea sloped upwards away from the stage. Immediately in
front oi the stage, a space was set apart lor the senators; and
later, a special place was assigned to the Equites also. The whole
ol the free population was admitted to the rest os the theatre,
without charge; the women sat at the extreme back os the cavea.
There was no seating accommodation‚ but the spectators probably
brought their own chairs or stools

The audience was turbulent and difficolt to control; it is evident
from the prologue to the Captivi that the beginning os a play was
liable to be disturbed by late-comers; and the main objectos the
prologue appears to be the securing of the attention and good-
humour oi the audience. A very good picture of the humours ol
the' cavea is given in the prologue to the Poenulus, where crying
babies, chattering women, and restlessness among the spectators
arethe least partos the difficulties with which the actors had to
contend.

The scene is nearly always laid in a street or square, outside the
house or houses os the principal characters. The doors opened
outwards on to the street, and it was usual to knock before coming
out of the house; hence a knock on the door means that someone
is leaving the house, not that someone is about to enter it. This

method oi opening the door outwards gave a good opportunity for
caves-droppers to overhear what was said hythe person leaving the
house, and yet to remain on the stage in full view os the audience;
and such situations are ol frequent occurrence.

the theatre at Athens, actors entering on the right of the stage
