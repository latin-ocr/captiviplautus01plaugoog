country.

The curtain was not dropped, as in a modern theatre, but was
raised¹ lrom the stage by means of pulleys.

lt has been already stated (pix) that the actors (histriones)
wore the Greek palleum, and not the Roman toga. The colour os
the pallium varied with the rfile of its wearer: old men wore white,
parasites black, gray, or bmwn, young men bright colours. A
familiar figure was the “semus currens'’, who bundled up his
pallium round his neck, that it might not impede his haste.

About the year 10013.C. Roscius Gallus introduced the use of
masks from Graece, where they had been employed in comedy
from very early times. Each mask was recognized by the spec-
tators as designating a particular class of persou; and it was
accordingly possible to tell at the first glauce whether an old man
was a domestic tyrant, a henpecked husband, a miser, or a genial
paterfamilias. There were nine recognized varieties os masks sor
old men, and so nine, aud only nine, kinds os old men could be
depicted by the dramatist. There were seven masks for slaves,
fourteen for young ladies, and three sor old.

The date of the first productiones the play is unknown, but can
be determined approximately by the help ol two historica] allusions
in the text. of these, the allusion in l. 888 to the Boii is sar from

· definite, for that nation caused the Romans almost ceaseless trouble

from the time os its great inroad and defeat at Telamon, ²²5 ue,

until its final crushing defeat at Mutina, 193. But this latter date, '

or the next year, will serve as a terminus adquam, or the allusion
would possess very little point. A comparison os the allusion (in
l. 90) to the Porta Trigemina, with Livy xxxv. 10, contributas some-
thing, lor Livy says that an empon'um existed outside that gate as
early as 193, but probably (as may be implied) not much earlier.
The probability then is that either the year ¹93 or 192 witnessed
the first performance os the play.
Nmong the writings os Plautus and Terence the Captivi occupies
