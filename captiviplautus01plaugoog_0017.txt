xii PLAUTI CAPTlVl

do indeed make their appearance in this play, but they are trans·
figured and glorified. The old man is the victim neither of senile
passion nor of tilial intrigue. Hegio, indeed, isone of the most
pleasing characters that walk the Roman stage. His geniality,
generosity‚ and open-heartedness are a very delightful change from
the usual caricature of a deluded dotard. Nor are the younger
characters worse drawn or less channing;-Tyndarus, the hero of
the piece, who stays in captivity to enable his master to escape,
and who faces the consequent punishment with a noble resigna·
tion, Philocrates,-a character far removed 'from the idle or vici'ous
young man of Roman comedy‚— who, after securing his own escape,
does not forget his faithful slave; Ergasilus the parasite, always
witty and amusing, yet, as so seldom occurs, ever avoiding adu-
lation and vulgarity.

The minor characters are equally well drawn. Aristophontes,
after being baited by Tyndarus until he flies into such a rage that
Hegio almost believes he is as mad as Tyndarus asserts, very
generously tries to heg his tormentor off when be learns the true
facts of the case. Philopolemus makes a very brief appearance,
but impresses us favourably3 the unrepentant Stalagmus meets his
deserts with a stolid and surly indifference3 and the Lorarii in·
dulge in the proper admixture of jocosity and indifference to the
fate and sufferings of their newly·acquired fellow-slaves.

The main interest of the drama lies in the newness ol its motive,
-the devotion of a slave to his master, and of a master to his
slave, instead of the wearisome repetition of the usually disgraceful
love intrigue; its whole atmosphere is simple and pure, and its
humour is'the humour of pathos rather than ol cynicism.

There is no need to follow the prologue in detail, as it is merely
an outline of the plot; but it is there explained that the scene is
laid in Aetolia, and the time is the occasion of a war between that
state and Elis. The two Captives, who are already on the stage,
have erchanged dresses for the purposes of their scheme; Tyndarus
the slave is now Philocrates the master, and vice versa

The speaker is Ergasilus, a parasite, who proceeds to explain his
