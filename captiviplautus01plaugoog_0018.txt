usual patron, Philopolemus, the son oi Hegio, who livea hard by,
is a prisoner oi war in Elis; while Hegio is engaged in buying up
Elean prisoners in the hope ol getting one ol sufficiently high rank
to exchange lor his son. .

Sc. 2 Hegio comes out os his house attended by a Lorarius, or
slave-driven Hegio bids him exchange the heavy letters which
the two Captives are wearing sor lighter ones, and is preparing to
depart when the parasite attracta his attention. Hegio communi-
cates to him his plan ol exchanging Philocrates against his·own
son Philopolemus, and after Ergasilus has screwed out ol him an
invitation to dinner, which he may accept or not, as he pleases,

his position as a prisoner. He then leaves the stage to provide
Philocrates with a passport and money sor the j'oumey, and aiter-

Act 111. Sc. 1. This is a monologue by Ergasilus, who lamenta
his ill-fortune in not securing a better invitation than Hegio's3 his
last hope is the harbom, whither he presently repairs.

Sc. 2 ln the meantime Hegio has discovered among his recent
purchases another Elean, named Aristophontes, who says that he
