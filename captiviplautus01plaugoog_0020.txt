explained to him; he is freed from his letters, and Stalagmus takes
his place in the quarries.

upssocua The high moral tone of the play is praised, aud the
spectators are asked to give their applause.

v. Prosouv

The peculiarities of the prosody of Plautus are due largely to the
unformed and changing state of the language in his time. lt is
impossible in the space of a short article to describe thern all in
detail, but the following main divisions may be observed :-

Hiatus is of frequent occurrence. Some editors seek to remove

it by the insertion of words not found in the MSS„ but it appears
that Plautus fairly regularly employed it at the diaeresis, at the
caesura, at a pause in the sense, at a change of spealcerS, and after
interjections. When long monosyllables ending in a vowel or ·m
are left unelided‚ or when a similar last long syllable of an iambus
is unelided, that long syllable becomes short in many cases; agn
Quia uera obessent illi quoi operam dabam.

Apooope. Certain letters at the end of a word were not pro·
nounced‚ or at any rate were not allowed to ·interfere with the
scansion. Thus the nom. sing. in -us or ·is is pronounced -u’ or
-i’ ; ag. 120 sumtis quam mimas, &c Again, the interrogative
particle ·ne was often pronounced as ·n’, and so remained even in
later Latin; ag. 643 certon. These two forms of apocope are found
in combination ; ag. 846 iuben for iubesne. ln these instances‚ if
the final syllable of the word to which ·ne is attached was short by
nature, it remains short; but if it was long, it may be either short ι
or long.
