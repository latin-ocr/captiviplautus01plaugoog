xvi PLAUTI CAPTlVl

8111100010 11 the contractior 01 two vowels into oue souud; eg.
42 adem, 622 deorum, 107 ms, 106 quotus, 800 diez

syncope is the omission 01 2 short vowel in the middle 01 2
word; ag. 8 altrum 101 altemm, and surpuit 101 sum'pait.

Unoontraoted or uneyncopated 1011111 01 words, 01 which the
syncopated 1011111 alone were used in classical Latin, are found;
ag. 620 expungam for expurgare, 655 nuculeus for nucleus.

The vowels ·l and -u are treated sometimes as consonants; ag.
197 [1111111. This consonantal treatment of -u gives us such forms
as sis for si uis, sultis 101 si uoltus.

1010110011οω short in classical Latin are often long in Plautus:
11 negat, 25 fit, 229 capita adnuimus, 333 es, 502 sta, 689 [ccle-
mm, 746 optigit, 782 auctr'or, 914 carne, 1023 regredior.

syllables long 111 0111111001 11111111 210 sometimes short in Plautus,
or at any rate it is necessary to scan them as short. These
syllables may be long by nature, or position, or both. A 1011111-
stances will be useful:

161. iu 1101 hic itidem fllic apdd uos 1111111 seruatur 1111111.
331 sed is priuatam seruitutem seruit illi an pdblicamf
⁴9⁸· Quid 111 rutulus quam bene 11111 gereret

⁵⁶⁸· Tu enim repertu's, Philocratem qui eriperes ueriuerbio.

⁹¹7· Coctim percontabatur, possentne 1611110 1011110010.
soar. de dic, oro, paternus 1111111 tun esf Ego sum, gnate mi.

lt will be noticed that all these instances are (in proper prosody)
01 one 01 the following forms: ψ - x or ν - 2, eg. 1111111 rel, quid
111 satim but Plautus shortens the long syllable which does not
bear the ictus. Observation 01 211 the instances will show that the
syllable he so shortens must be preceded by a short syllable, and Ι
that the ictus must fall either on the syllable which precedes, oron
that which follows the shortened syllable. ,

11 11 somewhat doubtful how this license is to be explained.
Prof. Ramsay supposes a running together 01 two syllables into
one, as quod 'mnes for quod omnes, &c , Others have believed

that Plautus did not observe the law of syllables lengthened by ’ ’

0011110111 but though this might explain the license in 1021, 101
instance, it would not explain that in 498. The true explanation
is probably that loreshadowed above, viz. that the shortening pro-
cess is due to the ictus, which tended to cause the neighbouring
syllables to be slurred.
