’ νι. Murra

The metres employed in Roman comedy were borrowed from
Greece, but in the hands of Plautus versification received a treat-
ment even more elastic than the Greek comedians had permitted
It must be remembered that the Greek method of scansion by
quantity had only been introduced into Italy about the time of the
birth of Plautus, while the original ltalian metre—the Saturnian—
had depended rather on cadence than on quantity. The scansion
of ' Plautus is accordingly, as might be expected, full of surprises

· to an ear trained only in the Greek method; but it must not be

assumed that it ison that account confused, imperfect, or licentious.

· Plautus employed very definite rules of metre, and carefully observed

them3 only these rules were both more numerous and wider than
the Greek, as well as better adapted to the exigencies of the Latin
language.

A foot is the combination of two, three, or four syllables possess·
ing defined quantities, but it is not necessary that all the syllables
of a foot should belong to one word. The following feet are used
in the verses of Plautus :-

Pyrrich νν as age. ssacchrus v - — as habendo.
Troehee —- υ ,, tange. Amphibrach . v - v „ habere.
Spondee - - „ venti. Proceleusmatrcv υ v ν ,, recipere.
Iambus ν - ,, malos. Choriambus - ν ν - ,, digrediens.
Tnbrach ν ν v „ agite. lonic a maiori - - ν ν ,, ingentia.
Dactyl — v ν ,, corpora lonie a minori υ ν - - ,‚ benefactis„
Crettc - ν - ,, temperant First Paeon - ν υ υ ,, corporibus.
Antibacchlus — - ν ,, tranquilla Second Paeon ν - ν v ‚, putamina.
Molossus - - - ,‚ tranquilli. fourth Paeon νννννν enevolens.
Anapaest ν ν - ‚, pecori.

A pair of feet, reckoning from the odd numbers, in lambio,
Trochaic, or Anapaestie verse, is called a dipodia or metre.

A verse consists of a number of feet in a definite order, and is
named according to the number of feet or metres that it contains.
Verses containing the stated number of completed feet or metres
are called Acatalectic; if one syllable is lacking at the end, they are
called Catalacum if two syllables are lacking, Brachy-catolectfc. If
there is a syllable over, after the last foot is completed, the verse is
called Hyper-catalectic.

Ictus is the stress laid upon one syllable in each foot, for the
purpose of representing the metre or rhythm more clearly3 but
as a rule only the first ictus in each dipodia is marked with an
accent.
