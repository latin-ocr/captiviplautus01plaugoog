xviii PLAUTI CAPTIVI

Arst's is the name given to that part oi the foot which receives
the ictus, because there the voice is raised (opu) ; the other partos
the ioot is called the Thetin because there the voice is dropped
(vidnde‘diera is a cutting (caedo) or break in averse, produced by
ending a dissyllabis or polysyllahle in the middle instead oi at the

end oi a foot. It is generally found about the middle of a verse, ,

and is lor the purpose of avoiding monotony oi rhythm

Diaeresir is a division (διαιρέω) of averse produced by making the
end of a dipodia in the middle ol a verse coincide with the end of a ,
word ’

The metres employed by Plautus in the Captim' are as follows :-

1.Jamr1·c.-(a)rhe lambic Senarius, or Trimeter Acatalectic.
This consisted in its pure form of six iambi, but Plautus allows
instead a spondee in any foot except the sixth. Now the resolution
of the long syllable oi an iambos into two shorts will produce a
tribrach; and the resolution of one of the long syllables of a spondee
will produce either a dactyl oran anapaest ; spondees‚ tribrachs,
dactyls‚ or anapaests are accordingly found in any foot except the
last. Even the proceleusmatic, which is the resolution of both
syllables of a spondee, is found in the first four feet. Τὴε scheme
is therefore as follows :—

For example, l. 200:
lndtg Ι ni dig Ι na hdben Ι ds silut Ι etde qm Ι stela

(β) The lambic Septenarius, or Tetrameter Catalectic. ln its
pure form this consists of seven iambi and one syllable; after the
fourth ioot is the diaeresis. Plautus invariably keeps the fourth
foot as an iambus (or pyrrich), but otherwise takes the same
liberties with this metre as with the iamhic senarius. The pro·
celeusmatic is, however, more sparingly used, and theu only in the
odd ieet. Thus the scheme is :-
