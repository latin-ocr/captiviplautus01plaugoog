lNTRODUCTION xxi

V. Gratia-The Cretic Tetrameter consisted of four cretics,
with diaeresis after the second. A molossus might take the place
of the cretic‚ and by the ordinary· resolution of one long syllable in
each foot, the following scheme is obtained :-

The first paeon and the ionic a maiori are not allowed in the
fourth foot. For example, 1. 217:

Vobis simiis Ι propt'e'r hanc ll rem quom qui'e' Ι uolumus nos.

The Cretic Dimeter is found only in composite verses (see below).

Vl. The remaining metres found in the Captivi are composite.
(a) Trochaic tripodia catalectic followedby acretic dimeter.

Eg„ 204· Nostrum ἔτ Ι llm sl Ι uos ΙΙ eximat Ι ιιῑηοιῖΙῐε.

(β) Cretic Dimeter followed by a trochaic dipodia acatalectic.

E.g., Μ’ sunnemwtunnremncntms. a,

(γ) Bacchiae dimeter followed by iambic tripodis catalectic.
