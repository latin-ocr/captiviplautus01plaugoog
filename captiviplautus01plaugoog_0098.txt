THE ARGUMENT

It is generally admitted that the argument is post-Plautiae in origin.
Though it contains numerous archaisms, these are to be explained as
intentional imitations of a Plautine diction. In some cases, however, as
Prof. Lindsay has pointed out, the composer has overstepped the mark; for
instance, knowing that the archaic termination of the noro. pl. masc. was
·ei, he has transferred this spelling to the penultimate, in disregard of the
derivation (the suffire uiro-l, which was always spelt with the single letter.
Other instances are the use of alius for atter in l. 2 ; studens ut, 4;

recupero, 4.
1. captust = captus cst ς the contractiori is due either to (i) tlre elision of

. the final -s before a vowel; or tii) the prodelision of the e· of est, or (iii)

{lli} ἓεηᾰῖηεγ to suppress one of two neighbouring unimportant syllables
tn say.

2. altune Alius is found in post-classical Latin instead of alter. The
use occurs in several of the arguments both of Plautus and Terence.

4. recuperet. This may corne from recupero, a word not found in
{ciffis or it may be an archaic spelling of recuperet. Cf. 103, m' illum

5. lbus for iis, if the MS. inr'bi is to be changed.
amium lost; but 7, amittatur = dimittatur, send away, let go.
6. Scan stl'd as a monosyllable.
7. ipsus, archaic for ipse.
9. quotus = cujus.
PROLOGUE

The Prologue, again, is probably post-Plautina The plays of Plautus
were revived about a hundred years after his death, and it is supposed that
the prologues belong to that period.
