The following translations of lines 401-418 may be compared and con·
trasted :—

Tynd. Say, Ι ’m well ;
And tell him, boldly tell him, that our souls
Were link’d in perfect harmony together ;

That nothing you have ever done amiss,

Nor have I ever been your enemy;

That in our sore affliction you maintain’d

Your duty to your master, nor once swerv'd

From your fidelity‚ in no one deed

Deserted me in time of my distress.

When that my father is inform'd of this,

And learns, how well your heart has been inclin’d
Both to his son and to himself, he 'll never

Prove such a niggard‚ but in gratitudo

He will reward you with your liberty3

And I, if I return, with all my power

Will urge him the more readily to do it.

For by your aid, your courtesy, your courage‚
Wisdom and prudence, you have been the means
Of my return to Aelis, since you own’d

To Hegio here my family and fortune,

By which you ’ve freed your master from his chains.

Phil. hue, lhave acted as you say z—and much
It pleases me, you bear it in remembrance.

What I have done was done to your desert:
For were 1 in my count to tell the sum

Of all your friendly offices towards me,

Night would bear off the day, ere I had done.
llou was obliging as obsequious tome,

As though you were my servant.
-Richard Wamer.
