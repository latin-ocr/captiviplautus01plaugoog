PLAUTI CAPTIVI

7yndarus (as Philocrates). Say Ι am well, and tell
him this, good Tyndarus,
We two have lived in sweetest harmony
otone accord in all things 3 never yet
Have you been faithless‚ never Ι unkind.
And still, in this our struit, you have been true
And loyal to the last, through woe and want,
Have never sailed me, nor in will nor decd.
This when your father hears, ior such good service
To him and to his son, he cannot choose
But give you liberty. Ι will ensure it,
It Ι go free from hence. 'Tis you alone,
Your heip, your kindness, your devoted service,
Shall give me to my parents' arms again.
Philocrates (as Tyndarus). I have done this: I’m
glad you should remember;
And you have well deserved ite (emphatically) for if Ι
Were in my turn to count up all the kindncss Ι ’
That you have shown to me, day would grow night
Beiore the tale were told. Were you my slave,
You could have shown no greater zeal to serve me.

-ΙΙιε Rev. W. L. Collr'ns.
