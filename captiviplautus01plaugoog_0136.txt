APPENDIX

MANUSCRIPTS, AND VARIATIONS IN THE TEXT

The most ancient MS. of Plautus belongs to the third or fourth century,
and its evidence is therefore particularly valuable. It is 3 palimpsest, ic.
originally 3 MS. of Plautus; it had the inlr washed off, and was covered
(about the 'ninth century) with 3 portion ol the Old Testament. ln order
to obtain the plays of Plautus, it was necessary to wash off the later writing
in turn, and then to restore the traces of the earlier. This MS. was well
and clearly written in uncinl letterS, hut is now very defective ; many leaves
have been lost altogether, and much of what remains is illegible. Of the
Captivi we have only lines 905-931 and 1008-1029. It is now in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan, and is known as Α.

Α particular interest attaches to D, a cursive MS. of the eleventh century,
now in the Vatican Library. This MS. was discovered in Germany in ⁴
1428, and aroused great enthusiasm, as in it were found the last twelve
plays of Plautus, which had been lost and forgotten for some centuries.
Besides these twelve plays, it contains Captivi, lines 1-503.

Of two other cursive MSS. of the tenth or eleventh century, discovered
and used by Camerarius, B, the “codex vetus Camerarii’', now in the
Vatiean, contains 311 the plays, while C, the “codex decurtatus ’', 31
Heidelburg, contains only the last twelve, the first eight having apparently
been torn off before Camerarius discovered it.

These are the main sources of the text of Plautus. A is in a class by
itself, but B C D are 311 supposed to have been derived from a now lost
archetype. Other MSS. exist, hut all have a more or less close affinity to
one or other of the three last mentioned, and are therefore of comparatively
small value as independent testimony.

J is a twelfth-century MS. in the British Museum‚ containing eight plays;
it has suffered from lire, and the ends and beginnings of lines are often
destroyed

V is another twelfth-century MS.. now at Leyden, containing four plays
and parts of two others.

E is of the twelfth century, and is now in the Ambrosian Library 31
Milan.

There is also a fragment of the Captivi (rano-5 5 5) in an eleventh-century
MS. called Ο in the Ottohonian collection in the Vatican Library.
